## 📘 Overview

The project compares **theoretical torque** (from datasheet parameters) with **practical measurements** from lab experiments.  
The study includes:
- Torque–speed and power relations  
- Gear ratio adjustments (13:1)  
- Comparison of rated, running, and stall conditions  

---

## 🔧 Methods

- Datasheet-based torque and power derivation  
- Practical measurement of voltage, current, and speed  
- Adjustment for gearbox ratio and efficiency  
- Analysis of differences between theoretical and real data  

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Practical torque aligns closely with theoretical values when adjusted for gear ratio  
- Small deviations are due to test voltage, efficiency losses, and shaft measurement point
